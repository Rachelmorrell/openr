# Netlink C++ Interface

This library provides C++ APIs to interact with kernel for networking state
via netlink protocol. The functionality is intentionally kept minimal to needs
of Open/R, but it can be extended. Below we describe the organization of code in
this directory. Refer to inline code documentation in header files for more
information.

## NetlinkTypes

Defines C++ classes to represent various routing information e.g. Address, Link,
Route etc. This serves as data representation between application code and 
netlink C++ library.

## NetlinkMessage

Defines base class that facilitates serialization and de-serialization of
message exchange with linux kernel.

Reference: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netlink.7.html

## NetlinkRoute

Specialization of netlink message for `NETLINK_ROUTE` (aka rtnetlink) family. It 
implements Addresses, Link, Neighbor and Route (IP, IPv6 & MPLS).

Reference: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtnetlink.7.html

## NetlinkProtocolSocket

Implements send and receive netlink messages with the use of `AF_NETLINK` socket
type. Also provides public APIs to get/add/del for Addresses, Link, Neighbor
and Routes.

## NetlinkSocket [DEPRECATED]

Further wraps NetlinkProtocolSocket for backward compatibility with previous C++
interface.
